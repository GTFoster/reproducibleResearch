What libraries are useful for it?

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
```





https://data.hrsa.gov//DataDownload/DD_Files/ORG_OTC_FCT_DET.csv (use medical data for this)






examining data (stay away from plotting since that goes on next week, but do some preliminary visualizations) mainly do mean, sd, range, ...




which 


apply


some filtering commands like is.na(), matrix indexing (mat[,1]), etc.

joins




group_by




summarise
