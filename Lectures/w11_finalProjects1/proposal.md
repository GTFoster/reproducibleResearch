# Final project proposal

Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea by **DATE DATE DATE**. The proposal should include:

- Title & description of the project
- Team members names
- A description of the data required, and how it will be obtained (e.g. URL/DOI to data source)
- 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing.


Please create your proposal in a markdown file called `proposal.md` in the root directory of the final project repo.






## Project Guidelines

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.


### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
