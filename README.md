## Reproducible research in R (Biol 4800)

Welcome! Let's learn about reproducibility in scientific research. Most of how we will learn about reproducibility is through learning how to use tools that help make our science reproducible. The course centers around a final project, which will ideally be end-to-end reproducible and versioned.
